modelplotr
==========

Plots to evaluate the business performance of predictive models in R. A number of widely used plots to assess the quality of a predictive model from a business perspective can easily be created.Using these plots, it can be shown how implementation of the model will impact business targets like response on a campaign. Also, the under/overperformance of a model on the train data compared to other datasets (test data, external validation data,...) can be visualized with a number of functions. See [this blog post](https://modelplot.github.io/intro_modelplotr.html) for further details and examples of using the package
